# Sudoku Generator

The Sudoku Generator was a project all about creating a generator for Sudoku puzzles which then lead on to allowing users to solve them.

The implementation for the puzzle generation and solving is all in PHP, I liked the idea of seeing if I could make it work - turns out you can!

Some ideas floating around:
- [x] Option to show conflicting cells.
- [x] Clear all player inputs when the seed has changed.
- [ ] JavaScript validation including real time error updates.
- [ ] Improve the CSS to make it more appealing to look at.
- [ ] Mobile friendly.
- [ ] Puzzle configuration should find its way to the URL query parameters so puzzles can be shared.
- [ ] A user system to allow saving puzzles in progress (we could do so much more once we have this).
- [ ] Load from local storage for people who don't want to make accounts.

Who knows where this will go!
