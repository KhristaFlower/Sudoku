# Sudoku Generator

The Sudoku Generator was a project all about creating a generator for Sudoku puzzles which then lead on to allowing users to solve them.

The implementation for the puzzle generation and solving is all in PHP, I liked the idea of seeing if I could make it work - turns out you can!

Some ideas floating around:
- Option to show conflicting cells.
- JavaScript validation.
- Clear all player inputs when the seed has changed (what about difficulty?).
- Improve the styles to make it more appealing to look at.
- Mobile friendly.

Who knows where this will go!
